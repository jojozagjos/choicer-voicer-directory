 * The shape of a shared pack, and the rules for whether one is acceptable.

 * This is stage one of docs/PLATFORM_PLAN.md and deliberately the first thing
 * written, because everything else is downstream of it: the submission form
 * fills one of these in, the review queue checks one, the app reads a list of
 * them, and the installer trusts nothing in one until it has been through here.
 *
 * Two rules shape the whole file:
 *
 *   Records are data from strangers. Every field is checked for type, length
 *   and shape before it is believed, and nothing is trusted because it came
 *   from the directory rather than from a person.
 *
 *   The platform never holds the pack. A record carries a link to wherever the
 *   author hosts it and a checksum of what should arrive, and that pairing is
 *   what makes hosting elsewhere safe.
 *
 * No dependencies, no filesystem, no network. It is pure so it can be tested
 * exhaustively and reused unchanged by a build script, the app, and eventually
 * a serverless check on submission.

 *
 * Safety. An installer that follows arbitrary addresses is an installer that
 * can be aimed at a local file, at `localhost`, or at something inside the
 * user's own network.
 *
 * It has to actually work. The app downloads the file itself, with no browser
 * and no logged-in session, so the address has to return the bytes. Plenty of
 * popular file hosts return an HTML page with a button on it instead:
 *
 *   drive.google.com   shows a virus-scan interstitial for anything large
 *   mega.nz            decrypts in their own client, there is no plain link
 *   mediafire.com      serves a landing page that has to be scraped
 *   itch.io            downloads run through a session and their API
 *
 * Allowing those would mean records that pass every check and then fail at the
 * moment someone presses install, which is the worst place to find out. They
 * are refused at submission with an explanation instead.
